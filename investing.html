                <h3>Journey of an investor.</h3>
                <p>People often get confused when it comes to understanding the stock market and<br>
                    investing, and consider it as a gambling market. But little do they know that the<br>
                    stock market, if understood & used correctly, can do wonders with your money!<br>
                    Here's a clear guide to help you find the perfect path to begin your investing journey,<br>
                    so that you can make the most out of the market.</p>

        <div class="two">
            <div class="ele">
                <h3>Who should drink water? Who should eat food? Who should exercise?</h3>
                <h4>That's right. Everyone.</h4>
                <p>Just like drinking water, eating food & staying fit are life's basic necessities, earning<br>
                    & growing money is also equally important. Everyone wants to increase their net<br>
                    worth, and wants to provide their family with a good life. And simply living from<br>
                    paycheck to paycheck is hardly going to suffice that. Hence, not investing is not an<br>
                    option. Just like you have to drink water to live, you have to invest to grow your<br>
                    money. Irrespective of your age and monthly income, the right investing will<br>
                    always bear full results and fruitful returns. So yes, anyone & everyone should<br>
                    invest.</p>

                    <h3>The sooner you start the better it is.</h3>
                    <p>Going back to what we started with, there is no right time to start drinking water,<br>
                        or eating food or exercise. You just do it whenever you feel thirsty, hungry or lazy.<br>
                        Similarly, there is no right time to start investing. Anyone can start investing at any<br>
                        age they want. The only thing that will differ will be the type of investment and its<br>
                        allocation, based on your income, savings and spendings and of course, your<br>
                        financial goals. A 12 year old will have different financial goals and risk taking<br>
                        capacity as compared to a 42 year old. So, your age will impact your investing style<br>
                        and not the when of when you should start investing.</p>

                            you're giving your hard earned money to a stranger to use it for something you<br>
                            don't even understand! So, the first and foremost step to start investing is to<br>
                            learn its basic concepts so that you can understand how the market works and<br>
                            make well-informed decisions. But, the lengthy & boring financial courses that<br>
                            are available in the market make this process dull. Here's where Quest by<br>

                    <p>Of course not! Then how can you expect this with investing? Investing<br>
                        requires practice, so the next step after learning concepts is to align what<br>
                        you've learnt with the real world. Before actually investing, witness the market<br>
                        in action and analyse a few stocks with the right information & data.<br>
                        Unfortunately, that's what's missing from today's equity research tools, where<br>
                        the data is often inaccurate. Ticker by Finolgy is specially designed to solve<br>
                        this problem by providing a vast data bank of all the listed companies. The<br>
                        best part? Ticker is completely technology-backed so that you can make<br>
